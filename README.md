A .asi plugin for Dying Light 2 that allows you to load custom .pak files.
To use, simply put the files next to the game .exe, and create a folder named CustomPaks and put your mods in there.
There is also a basic load order system, which can be edited in LoadOrder.txt. You can also disable the console window in the CustomPaksLoader.ini
